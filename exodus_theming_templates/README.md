# Exodus-specific drawables list

The purpose of these templates is to provide support for themers wanting to create themes that support Exodus
by incorporating our custom drawables.

There is a zip file containing all of these images that can be used as an example of what's necessary for full support.
If you've made a theme compatible with Exodus, please share it with our google+ community and the developers will
gladly reshare!
